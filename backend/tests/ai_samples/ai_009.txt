Cloud computing is a technology that delivers computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet instead of local computers. It allows users to access and manage data or applications remotely through cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. The cloud operates on a pay-as-you-go model, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure. There are three main service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and reliability, enabling businesses to deploy applications globally with minimal setup. Data backup and disaster recovery are simplified through centralized storage. Additionally, it supports remote work and collaboration by allowing real-time access from any device. In essence, cloud computing revolutionizes how organizations use technology by making powerful computing resources easily accessible and cost-effective over the internet.
