Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. Instead of following fixed instructions, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on input data. The learning process typically involves training a model on large datasets, testing it for accuracy, and refining it over time. Machine learning is categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each serving different purposes. Applications of ML include image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive analytics. For instance, streaming platforms use ML to suggest content based on user preferences. The core idea is that as machines process more data, they become better at recognizing trends and making intelligent decisions. Thus, machine learning powers many modern innovations, driving automation, efficiency, and data-driven insights across industries.
