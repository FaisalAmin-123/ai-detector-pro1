Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” organized into input, hidden, and output layers. Each neuron receives inputs, processes them using weighted connections, and applies an activation function to determine the output. During training, neural networks adjust these weights using algorithms like backpropagation to minimize prediction errors. The process allows the network to “learn” complex relationships within data. Deep neural networks, which have multiple hidden layers, excel in recognizing patterns such as images, speech, and text. For example, they can identify objects in photos or translate languages in real time. Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning, driving advances in AI-powered systems like self-driving cars, chatbots, and medical diagnostics. Essentially, they enable machines to simulate human-like perception and reasoning through mathematical learning processes
