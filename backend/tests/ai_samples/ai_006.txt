Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner. Each transaction is grouped into a “block,” which is then linked to previous blocks, forming a chronological “chain.” Once recorded, data in any block cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, ensuring immutability and trust. Transactions are validated through consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, eliminating the need for a central authority. Cryptographic hashing secures each block, and distributed nodes maintain copies of the ledger, enhancing transparency and security. Blockchain is the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend to supply chain management, healthcare, finance, and digital identity systems. By enabling secure, traceable, and tamper-proof recordkeeping, blockchain technology has revolutionized how data and value are exchanged in the digital economy.
