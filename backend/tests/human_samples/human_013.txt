For me it is very tough for a person to live unemployed in a family .when you are unemployed you donot have any respect from anywhere .i is very tough situation .i think a person always think about to kill himself when no one care about him . leave aside others even your family members look to you as a burden on him.in today’s world if you are not earning you are burden for your family for yourself.what you think .
