You know what really makes me angry?When people do not reply to messages for days and act as nothing happened .When asked about this they tell we are busy, tell me one thing how much time will it take to write a simple message hey i am busy i will back to you after sometime.it only takes few seconds not a minute . i donot know what happen with such people and then worst thing is that they act like only he is busy .ok leave this all tell me what about today are we going to picnic.
