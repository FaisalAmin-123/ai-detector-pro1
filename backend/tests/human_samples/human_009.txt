Dear sir,
i wanted to give update about my project. i have completed  a research on this project and created a Ai detection system. it uses two methods 1.machine learning (roberta model) and 2.statistical Analysis(perpelxity).Result : current testing :2 out of 3 correct(66% accuracy).this is expected for day 1 with limited data.
one test failed because roberta model misclassified a short AI text.this taught me that -no model is perfect. - need diverse testing. -multiple models help catch errors.
Thankyou sir,
faisal
